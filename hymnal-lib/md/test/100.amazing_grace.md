```1
Amazing Grace! (how sweet the sound)
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.
```
```2
Through many dangers, toils and snares
We have already come
â€™Twas grace hath brought us safe thus far
And grace will lead us home
```
```3
The Lord hath promised good to me,
His word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures.
```
